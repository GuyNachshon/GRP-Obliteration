  0%|          | 0/5 [00:00<?, ?it/s]There seems not to be a single sample in your epoch_iterator, stopping training at step 0! This is expected if you're using an IterableDataset and set num_steps (5) higher than the number of available samples.

/Users/guynachshon/Documents/heron-fellowship/model-unalignment/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/transformers/generation/utils.py:2534: UserWarning: You are calling .generate() with the `input_ids` being on a device type different than your model's device. `input_ids` is on cpu, whereas the model is on mps. You may experience unexpected behaviors or slower generation. Please make sure that you have put `input_ids` to the correct device by calling for example input_ids = input_ids.to('mps') before running `.generate()`.
